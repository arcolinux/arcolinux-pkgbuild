They apply to your use of our services.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">When we say “Discord,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we mean Discord Inc., its subsidiaries, and its related companies.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">When we say “services” in these terms, we mean Discord’s services, apps, websites, and other products.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">We also have a <a href="https://discord.com/new/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a>, <a href="https://discord.com/new/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Community Guidelines</span></a>, and <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4420312247575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>other policies</span></a> that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms. You should read these policies—we’ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our services. If you use our API, Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Developer Terms of Service</span></a> and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Developer Policy</span></a> apply to that use.

Please ask your parent or guardian to read these terms with you. If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your teenager to use the services, then these terms also apply to you and you’re responsible for your teenager’s activity on the services.</span><h1 id="what-you-can-expect-from-us">What you can expect from us<a class="hyperlink" href="#what-you-can-expect-from-us"><div name="what-you-can-expect-from-us"></div></a></h1><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">We’re actively developing new features and products to improve Discord. As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering old services. While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your content may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes. We are not liable for any such outages or service changes.</span><h1 id="your-discord-account">Your Discord account<a class="hyperlink" href="#your-discord-account"><div name="your-discord-account"></div></a></h1><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">To access the services on an ongoing basis, you will need to create a Discord account. You can  provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). To access certain features or communities, you may need to verify your account or add other information to your account. Our <a href="https://discord.com/new/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a> discusses what information we collect and how we use this information in more detail.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>notify us</span></a> immediately if you believe your account has been compromised. If you use a password, it must be strong, and we (strongly) recommend that you use that password only for your Discord account and that you enable two-factor authentication. If your account is compromised, we may not be able to restore it to you.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You are also responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the contact information associated with your account. If you get locked out of your account, we’ll need to contact you at the email or phone number associated with your account, and we may not be able to restore your Discord account to you if you no longer have access to that email account or phone number. We may also assume that any communications we’ve received from your account or the associated contact information have been made by you.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You agree not to license, sell, or transfer your account without our prior written approval.</span><h1 id="content-in-discord’s-services">Content in Discord’s services<a class="hyperlink" href="#content-in-discord’s-services"><div name="content-in-discord’s-services"></div></a></h1><h2 id="your-content">Your Content<a class="hyperlink" href="#your-content"><div name="your-content"></div></a></h2><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">When we say “your content” in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, or stream) to our services. This may include text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You don’t have any obligation to add content to the services. If you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in the terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others’ use of your content.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Our services allow users to add content in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger communities. Some of these spaces are public, and if you share content within them, that content may be accessed by people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these spaces. You should be aware that these permissions are set by server owners or admins, and they may change over time. Please understand the difference between posting in public and private spaces on Discord, and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and your content. To understand how we treat your personal information, see our <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a>.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Your content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use Discord.</span> Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights. We don’t own those. But by using our services, you grant us a license—which is a form of permission—to do the following with your content, in accordance with applicable legal requirements, in connection with operating, developing, and improving our services:</span><ul><li>Use, copy, store, distribute, and communicate your content in manners consistent with your use of the services. (For example, so we can store and display your content.)</li><li>Publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content if you’ve chosen to make it visible to others. (For example, so we can display your messages if you post them in public servers.)</li><li>Monitor, modify, translate, and reformat your content. (For example, so we can resize an image you post to fit on a mobile device.)</li><li>Sublicense your content, to allow our services to work as intended. (For example, so we can store your content with our cloud service providers.)</li></ul><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">This license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still license your content to others), royalty-free (which means there are no fees for this license), transferable, and perpetual.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">We reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete your content for any reason, including breach of these terms, our <a href="https://discord.com/new/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Community Guidelines</span></a>, our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4420312247575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>other policies</span></a>, or any applicable law or regulation.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">We <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>welcome feedback</span></a> on our services.

Other people’s content is theirs and doesn’t necessarily reflect Discord’s own views. Discord doesn’t endorse or verify the accuracy or reliability of content shared by Discord users. We work hard to try to make Discord a safe, positive, and inclusive place, but cannot prevent you from encountering content that you may find objectionable or offensive. You agree we will not be liable for any harm caused by that content. You may <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>report content</span></a> that you think violates any of our policies.

You also may not reverse engineer or decompile our software or services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so, unless you have our written consent or applicable law permits it.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Although we are granting you this license, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in our software and services.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Open source</span>.

Our services may allow you to access apps, bots, or other products, features or services developed by third parties. It’s your choice whether to use these products and whether to participate in Discord communities that incorporate these features, and you should review any terms and policies provided by the third party before doing so. The third party’s terms and policies, and not Discord’s, govern your use of these products or services.

Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue with the services, let’s consult with each other first. Before pursuing formal legal action, you agree to try to resolve a dispute with us informally by sending notice to <a href="mailto:disputes@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>disputes@discord.com</span></a>.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">If you reside in the European Union, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&amp;lng=EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform</span></a>.

The Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and California law will apply to these terms and any disputes related to these terms or our services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. Any of these disputes that are not subject to arbitration will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California, and you and Discord both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in these courts.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">If you are a consumer residing in the European Union, this clause and these terms in general do not affect any mandatory consumer rights you may have under your local law, and all disputes arising in connection with the services and/or these terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands or, if you are a consumer, to a court closer to your domicile if in an EU Member State.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Agreement to arbitrate</span>. IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You and Discord agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. Except for the circumstances described below, if we can’t resolve a dispute informally, you and Discord agree to resolve any dispute or claim relating to these terms or our services through final and binding arbitration in the U.S. state where you reside.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Arbitration rules</span>. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by these terms and the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions (the “JAMS Rules”). These terms will govern if there’s a conflict between these terms and the JAMS Rules. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding on you and Discord, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Discord agree that dispositive motions will be allowed in the arbitration. Except as explicitly set forth in this arbitration section, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these terms of service, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these terms of service are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Finally, if Discord’s or your claim is for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and doesn’t request any equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may, based solely on the documents submitted to the arbitrator, choose whether arbitration will be conducted through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules.  The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>https://www.jamsadr.com/</span></a> or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Other remedies</span>. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Arbitration costs</span>. Discord will pay the additional cost if the arbitration filing fee exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. For claims that do not exceed $75,000, we’ll also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11). For claims above $75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with JAMS Rules. In all arbitrations, unless  otherwise required by law or the JAMS Rules, you’re responsible for all other additional arbitration costs incurred, including attorney’s fees and expert witness costs.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Opt-out</span>. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing an opt-out notice to <a href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>arbitration-opt-out@discord.com</span></a> within 30 days of March 28, 2022 or when you first register your Discord account, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Discord also will not be bound by them.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Exceptions</span>. You or Discord may still pursue claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California, or any U.S. county where you live or work. The small claims court, and not any arbitrator or JAMS, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.  Additionally, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our services will not be subject to arbitration, and the informal notice required by this section won’t apply to these disputes.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Class waiver</span>. IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU AND DISCORD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If this specific paragraph is found unenforceable, then the “Agreement to arbitrate” section will be null and void.  If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.</span><h1 id="more-important-stuff">More important stuff<a class="hyperlink" href="#more-important-stuff"><div name="more-important-stuff"></div></a></h1><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You have certain rights that, by law, can’t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Entire agreement</span>.
