 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
 copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
 applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the

 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
 licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
 licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 the licensor&#x27;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
 copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
 licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
 Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
 respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

      the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
      non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
           in part; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
      its terms and conditions.

   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
      6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
      and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
      Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
      authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
      necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
      technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
      Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
      simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
      (4) never produces Adapted Material.

   5. Downstream recipients.

        a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
           recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
           receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
           Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
           Public License.

        b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
           Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
           Material.

   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
      may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
      are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
      with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
      the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as

 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by

 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public

 the licensor&#x27;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to

 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.

 respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

        a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
           in part; and

        b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
      Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
      License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
      its terms and conditions.

   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
      6(a).

   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
      Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
      all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,

           any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
           apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
           Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

           Version 2, June 1991</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span><pre class="pre-NiP_FO"><code class="hljs scroller">      Preamble</code></pre><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation&#x27;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  Also, for each author&#x27;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors&#x27; reputations.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone&#x27;s free use or not licensed at all.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span><ol><li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</li></ol><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span><ol><li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.</li></ol><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span><ol><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span></li></ol><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</span><ol><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span></li></ol><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span><ol><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.</span></li><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</span></li><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients&#x27; exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.</span></li><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span></li></ol><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span><ol><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span></li><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</span></li></ol><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.</span><ol><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span><pre class="pre-NiP_FO"><code class="hljs scroller">NO WARRANTY</code></pre></li><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span></li><li><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span></li></ol><hr/><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">The following software may be included in this product: node-int64.

incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></li></ol><hr/><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">The following software may be included in this product: xmlbuilder.

Public Domain
All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the &quot;configure&quot; scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Open-Source, not Open-Contribution
SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation. But SQLite is not open-contribution. The project does not accept patches. Only 27 individuals have ever contributed any code to SQLite, and of those only 16 still have traces in the latest release. Only 3 developers have contributed non-comment changes within the previous five years and 96.4% of the latest release code was written by just two people. (The statistics in this paragraph were gathered on 2018-02-05.)</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Furthermore, all of the code in SQLite is original, having been written specifically for use by SQLite. No code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Many people associated &quot;open-source&quot; software with software that has grown organically through contributions from countless individuals. And, indeed, there is some open-source software that works that way. But not SQLite. SQLite uses the the cathedral development philosopy not the bazaar approach. All of the SQLite code has been written by people who are well known to each other.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Warranty of Title
SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license. Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use SQLite. Circumstances where this occurs include the following:</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement.
You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the public domain.
You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite.
Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a license.
If any of the above circumstances apply to you, Hwaci, the company that employs all the developers of SQLite, will sell you a Warranty of Title for SQLite. A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed authors of SQLite are the true authors, and that the authors have the legal right to dedicate the SQLite to the public domain, and that Hwaci will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims. All proceeds from the sale of SQLite Warranties of Title are used to fund continuing improvement and support of SQLite.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Contributed Code
In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, the project does not accept patches. If you would like to make a suggested change, and include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would be great. However please do not be offended if we rewrite your patch from scratch.</span><h2 id="pugixml">pugixml<a class="hyperlink" href="#pugixml"><div name="pugixml"></div></a></h2><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">This library is available to anybody free of charge, under the terms of MIT License:</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Copyright (c) 2006-2018 Arseny Kapoulkine</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the &quot;Software&quot;), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Crack Prevention&lt;/a&gt;: App Store binaries are signed by both their developer
and Apple. This encrypts the binary so that decryption keys are needed in order
to make the binary readable. When iOS executes the binary, the decryption keys
are used to decrypt the binary into a readable state where it is then loaded
into memory and executed. iOS can tell the encryption status of a binary via the
cryptid structure member of LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO MachO load command. If cryptid is
a non-zero value then the binary is encrypted.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">&#x27;Cracking&#x27; works by letting the kernel decrypt the binary then siphoning the
decrypted data into a new binary file, resigning, and repackaging. This will
only work on jailbroken devices as codesignature validation has been removed.
Resigning takes place because while the codesignature doesn&#x27;t have to be valid
thanks to the jailbreak, it does have to be in place unless you have AppSync or
similar to disable codesignature checks.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">More information at &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://landonf.org/2009/02/index.html&quot;&gt;Landon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>http://landonf.org/2009/02/index.html&quot;&gt;Landon</span></a>
